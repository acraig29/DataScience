It\'s beautiful, the dying sun\nThe end of everything and everyone\nSo shall we make a clan my friend\nAs if we have the chance to live it all again\n\nI\'ll see you in some other lifetime\nOn the other side of what we\'ll never know\nTogether we have walked a fine line\nNow we go to face the universe alone\n\nIn plain view, the mistakes we\'ve made\nBut is there anything you\'d really want to change\nTo win and lose then win again\nTo have it all then throw it all away\n\nI\'ll see you in some other lifetime\nOn the other side of what we\'ll never know\nTogether we have walked a fine line\nNow we go to face the universe alone\n\nHow beautiful the closing down\nThe fading out, it spins and goes around\nWith darkness and the heart of man\nAnd here we are back where it all began\n\nI\'ll see you in some other lifetime\nThe universe alone\nThe universe alone\nThe universe alone
