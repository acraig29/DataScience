Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue\r\nThought I heard you talking softly\r\nI turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio\r\nStill I can\'t escape the ghost of you\r\n\r\nWhat has happened to it all?\r\nCrazy, some\'d say\r\nWhere is the life that I recognize?\r\nGone away\r\n\r\nBut I won\'t cry for yesterday\r\nThere\'s an ordinary world\r\nSomehow I have to find\r\nAnd as I try to make my way\r\nTo the ordinary world\r\nI will learn to survive\r\n\r\nPassion or coincidence\r\nOnce prompted you to say\r\n"Pride will tear us both apart"\r\nWell now pride\'s gone out the window\r\nCross the rooftops\r\nRun away\r\nLeft me in the vacuum of my heart\r\n\r\nWhat is happening to me?\r\nCrazy, some\'d say\r\nWhere is my friend when I need you most?\r\nGone away\r\n\r\nBut I won\'t cry for yesterday\r\nThere\'s an ordinary world\r\nSomehow I have to find\r\nAnd as I try to make my way\r\nTo the ordinary world\r\nI will learn to survive\r\n\r\nPapers in the roadside\r\nTell of suffering and greed\r\nFear today, forgot tomorrow\r\nOoh, here besides the news\r\nOf holy war and holy need\r\nOurs is just a little sorrowed talk\r\n\r\nAnd I don\'t cry for yesterday\r\nThere\'s an ordinary world\r\nSomehow I have to find\r\nAnd as I try to make my way\r\nTo the ordinary world\r\nI will learn to survive\r\n\r\nEvery one\r\nIs my world, (I will learn to survive)\r\nAny one\r\nIs my world, (I will learn to survive)\r\nAny one\r\nIs my world\r\nEvery one\r\nIs my world
