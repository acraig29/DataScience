This is where it starts\r\nStanding on the roof up here\r\nSaying goodbye to darkness\r\nNow I can see the big idea\r\nCities East and West\r\nYou won\'t miss me when I\'m gone\r\nThe only thing that\'s left is\r\nThe feeling that I\'m moving on\r\n\r\nSo you walk the line\r\nBut something inside you says no way\r\nAre we losing time\r\n\'Cause I waited long enough\r\n\r\nI can change the skyline\r\nOut of range but in time\r\nTime to change the skyline\r\nI see far horizons\r\n\r\nAn empire in a day\r\nBuilt on hope and burnt by the sun\r\nBut I\'m happy to watch it fade\r\nWhen I can raise it up again\r\n\r\nOpening my eyes\r\nMaybe it\'s not impossible\r\nDon\'t you think it\'s time\r\n\'Cause I waited long enough\r\n\r\nI can change the skyline\r\nOut of range but in time\r\nTime to change the skyline\r\nI see far horizons\r\n\r\nI can change the skyline\r\nOut of range but in time\r\nTime to change the skyline\r\nIcy far horizons
