I spin off and lose my head\r\nThrowing stray a spark instead\r\nGather strength down in my heel\r\nAnd dig it in the world I peel \r\n\r\nWay down deep within my heart\r\nLies a soul that\'s torn apart\r\nTell me, tell me what your after\r\nI just want to get there faster\r\n\r\nI don\'t live - I inhale\r\nI don\'t give - I unveil\r\nDon\'t want to live in your misery\r\nI don\'t live - I inhale\r\n\r\nSprinkle all my kisses on your head\r\nStars full of wishes fill our beds\r\nShe said, "I\'m dead"\r\n\r\nAll this pain smothers me\r\nLike a bomb that you can\'t see\r\nTell me, tell me what your after\r\nI just want to get there faster\r\n\r\nI don\'t live - I inhale\r\nI don\'t give - I unveil\r\nI don\'t live - I inhale\r\nI don\'t live
