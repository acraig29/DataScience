My reflection dirty mirror \r\nThere\'s no connection to myself \r\nI\'m your lover  I\'m your zero \r\nI\'m the face in your dreams of glass \r\nSo save your prayers \r\nFor when you\'re really gonna need \'em \r\nThrow out your cares and fly \r\nWant to go for a ride? \r\n\r\nShe\'s the one for me \r\nShe\'s all I really need, oh yeah\r\nShe\'s the one for me \r\n\r\nEmptiness is loneliness  and loneliness is cleanliness \r\nAnd cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me \r\nIntoxicated with the madness, I\'m in love with my sadness \r\nBullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms \r\nThe fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth \r\n\r\nI never let on, that I was on a sinking ship \r\nI never let on that I was down \r\nYou blame yourself, for what you can\'t ignore \r\nYou blame yourself for wanting more \r\n\r\nShe\'s the one for me \r\nShe\'s all I really need, oh yeah\r\nShe\'s the one for me \r\nShe\'s my one and only
